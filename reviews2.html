										We are pleased with Anson for his patience and passion to
										his works. He never leave us to handle the problems by
										ourselves even the renovation progress was not as smooth as
										we expected to. The team was proactive and ensures that the
										renovation complete within the target date. 8 months after
										the completion, we found some problem and tried to call
										Anson for solution but we couldn't get him thru phone call,
										so end up we just let it be. However, we received a call
										from Ken after a month, telling us his colleague Anson was
										no longer with DM+. He called to follow up on the renovation
										works which was done by Anson a year ago. We are really
										impressed with this follow up call! During the course of the
										touch up works, Ken kept us well updated. We could just
										leave it all to him and enjoyed our own sweet time.
										Appreciate his responsiveness and every effort to rectify
										all the defects even after a period of time. Good job! DM+ .

										We have found DM+ to be very professional and co-operative
										in their approach. They have the capacity for new ideas,
										many of which were implemented with good results. Their
										designer looks young but please do not underestimate their
										capabilities especially in design which they displayed great
										passion to give their professional views. They are good in
										listening to your needs and thoughts and able to communicate
										freely before finalizing our overall design concept. The
										team also shown magnificent maturity in handling problems or
										issues during the construction of our house and ensure the
										quality of their work continues to be of a high standard.
										The end results were what we expected and I just can sum all
										this into 3R- Responsive, responsible, and reliable!

										I got to know about DM+ from my friend and he introduced me
										to Kenson who liaise with me throughout the project. It was
										a very enjoyable and smooth process with them. At the start,
										they learnt more about what I wanted first and provided me
										with lots of information on what they can do and their
										suggestions. Since it is my first house renovation and I
										wanted to see other options so I took a while to get back to
										them, in the end, I decided to settle on DM+ as their
										pricing is not too cheap or too expensive which is great
										because I can ensure quality and still meet my budget.
										During the project, they were also efficient and
										professional throughout. There are bound to have some
										impromptu issues or concerns, but they are always quick to
										explain it clearly to me and provide me with different
										solution to consider. After living in this house for awhile
										now, all I can say is that my family, and I enjoyed every
										part of the house a lot. Really thankful for my friend to
										recommend me about DM+ and thankful for Kenson and his
										team’s quick replies, efficient, professional, and great
										service since the start of the project till the end of the
										project.

										As a perfectionist, I had lots of expectations throughout
										the renovation, especially when this is renovation for my
										first home. After lots of researching on the internet and
										getting quotes from different companies, I have decided to
										engage DM+ as they seem to have the most worth for value and
										have an in-house workshop with experience carpentry workers.
										I am very glad to say that DM+ did not let me down and was
										able to meet my standards. Furthermore, due to my
										indecisiveness and attention to details, I always go back to
										them and ask whether can change this or that and ask them if
										it is better done some other ways. But they were always so
										patient, insightful, and professional when it comes to the
										details of the carpentry works, and always advise me what is
										the best solution for my concern and doubts. We would like
										to thank the DM+ team for being so attentive to details,
										professional, insightful, patient and most importantly
										making out first home renovation an enjoyable and beautiful
										one for us! Really love how my home is now and everyone that
										came to our house are always in awe with the high-quality
										carpentry works and the design of it.

										Me and my wife was looking for ID contractors to build a
										master bedroom platform and also a decking platform at our
										balcony. DM+ was selected out of countless ID contractors we
										approached as apart from being competitive in price, they
										are responsive, thorough and honest in the early stage.
										Their carpenter and workers are professional and very
										detailed, they help us to touch up the paint of our
										partition wall at the TV area even when the dirt is not done
										by them. Although there was a crazy rush in completing our
										project, their works were not compromised. Their
										workmanships remain good. We are definitely satisfied with
										DM+’s fine quality and competence in price and shall not
										hesitate to recommend their services to our friends and
										family in the future. Thanks for the nice works!
